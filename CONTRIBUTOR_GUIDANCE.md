# :wave: Hey there

We're very happy that you consider contributing to our projects during Google Summer of Code 2023. Please **introduce yourself** on the available [project ideas](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal+label%3Aideas) in the [issues](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023/issues) section of this repo. 

**This repo ([gsoc-2023](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023)) is only for managing ideas and inform potential contributors. There will be no mandatory qualifying task in this repo, nor will any project development happen in here. Find the corresponding project repos by going to the [issues section](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal+label%3Aideas), select the project you want to learn about or contribute to and follow the link to the repo in the description.**

You can send an introductory message to the project's main mentor anytime before March 20.

In your introduction, please include answers to the following questions:

- [ ] What interests you most about this project?
- [ ] As mentors and project coordinators, how can we get the best out of you?
- [ ] Is there anything that you’ll be studying or working on whilst working alongside us?
- [ ] We'd love to hear a bit on your work preferences, e.g. how you keep yourself organized, what tools you use, etc?
- [ ] Once you’ve selected a project from the [ideas](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/gsoc-2023/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal+label%3Aideas) section, please suggest a weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it. Alternatively, if you want to propose your own idea then please include outline, goals, and a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables.

MANDATORY QUALIFICATION TASK:
Please engage on your selected project (link to each GitHub repo is in the issue description) by picking up an existing issue tagged "first issue". If no first issues are available, get in contact with the main mentor as listed in the repo's README.md and get individual advice.

Please complete the matching mandatory qualification task before you apply through the GSoC platform between March 20 and April 4. When applying with your own idea please check with the mentors/org admins beforehand to see which qualification task would be a good match. 

**Applications without completed mandatory qualification task will not be considered**.
